The **firmware in the boot ROM** of every Retro-Active main board. Brings the system up at power-on, finds something bootable on the [I/O card](/projects/io-card/), loads a kernel image into RAM, and hands control over.

Status: **design phase**, with the existing FemtoRV monitor as the reference implementation to port.

## What it does at boot

Boot sequence, in order:

1. **CPU init** — vector table, stack pointer, simple memory-clear pass.
2. **Probe slots** — walk the IO region, read each slot's identification register, build a list of "what's plugged in." This is also the system's first taste of slot-card discovery.
3. **Probe storage** — find an [I/O card](/projects/io-card/), bring up its SD/FAT32 driver, look for `/kernel.bin` (or `/boot.cfg` pointing at it).
4. **Load kernel** — read the kernel image from SD into RAM at the configured load address.
5. **Jump** — set up minimal kernel arguments (boot params block: detected slot map, RAM size, console UART address) and jump.

If anything in steps 2–5 fails — no SD card, no kernel image, kernel image fails its checksum — the bootloader drops into:

## The serial monitor

A small command-line interpreter on the I/O card's UART. Inspired by the FemtoRV monitor; the command set is intentionally minimal:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `H` | Help |
| `D <addr> <len>` | Hex-dump memory |
| `E <addr>` | Edit memory (interactive) |
| `S <slot>` | Read slot's identification + status registers |
| `L` | Receive a kernel image via XMODEM, store at the kernel-load address |
| `G [<addr>]` | Go (jump to addr, or to the loaded kernel) |
| `M` | Memory map |
| `B` | Reboot |

This is what saves you when the kernel won't load. It's also the bring-up tool when you've just plugged in a new card and want to poke its registers without writing software.

## Portable C

The bootloader is one C source tree. It compiles against four GCC backends:

- `cc65` for 6502 (or `llvm-mos` for the more aggressive optimizer)
- `m68k-elf-gcc` for 68000
- `i386-elf-gcc` for 8086 (real mode)
- `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` for RISC-V soft cores

Each target gets a tiny CPU-specific bring-up file (vector table, reset handler, register save/restore for the monitor's exception handler). Everything else — the SD driver, the FAT32 reader, the XMODEM, the command parser — is portable.

The 6502 case is tightest. cc65's calling convention burns RAM for the parameter stack; the bootloader has to be careful about depth and avoid recursion. 8 KB is realistic; 4 KB is a stretch.

## Boot configuration

`/boot.cfg` on the SD card is plain text. Example:

```ini
kernel=/kernel.bin
load=0x8000
args=video=slot5 audio=slot7 io=slot1
```

The kernel finds its argument string in a fixed memory location (above the kernel-load region) and parses it. Driver-binding decisions are made there.

## Dependencies

- **A main board** with a boot ROM socket and at least one [I/O card](/projects/io-card/) slot
- **Driver library** entries for SD/FAT32 and UART (the bootloader needs these even before the kernel exists)
- A **kernel image** to load (either the [microkernel + single-user OS](/projects/single-user-os/) or whatever the user wants to boot)

## Next steps

1. Port the FemtoRV monitor commands to portable C, factor out the cc65/m68k-specific assembly.
2. Hook in the FAT32 reader from the existing RetroKernel.
3. Define the kernel-load image format (header magic, length, checksum, entry point).
4. Define the boot-args block format.
5. First-light testing on a 6502 main board.

Contributions wanted: anyone who's written a small monitor before, reviewers for the boot-args format, anyone with strong opinions about what command set the monitor should expose.
